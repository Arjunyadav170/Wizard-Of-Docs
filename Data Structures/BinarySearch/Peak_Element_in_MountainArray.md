# Finding Peak_Element Index in a Mountain_array 

## Problem Description

An array `arr` a **mountain** if the following properties hold:

- `arr.length >= 3`
- There exists some `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
    - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
    - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

Given a mountain array `arr`, return the index `i` such that `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`.

You must solve it in `O(log(arr.length))` time complexity.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input**: arr = [0,1,0]
**Output**: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input**: arr = [0,2,1,0]
**Output**: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [0,5,10,2]
Output: 2
```

## Solution

By using basic Principle of binary Search and making small adjustment for this question 

the code is below 👇🏽 in Java 

```java
public class Mountain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
				int[] array = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 30, 20, 10};
				int result  = peakIndexInMountainArray(array);
				System.out.println(result);
					
    }
// here we mentioned the method to be static, because if the method is static we can access that method without an object(i.e , we can access the method directly with its name).

    public static int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] arr) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.length - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] > arr[mid+1]) {
                // you are in dec part of array
                // this may be the ans, but look at left
                // this is why end != mid - 1
                end = mid;
            } else {
                // you are in asc part of array
                start = mid + 1; // because we know that mid+1 element > mid element
            }
        }
        // in the end, start == end and pointing to the largest number because of the 2 checks above
        // start and end are always trying to find max element in the above 2 checks
        // hence, when they are pointing to just one element, that is the max one because that is what the checks say
        // more elaboration: at every point of time for start and end, they have the best possible answer till that time
        // and if we are saying that only one item is remaining, hence cuz of above line that is the best possible ans
        return start; // or return end as both are =
    }
}
```
